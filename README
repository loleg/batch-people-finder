Batch uploader for People Finder

# DESCRIPTION

Created at #RHoK Basel, Switzerland - June 4, 2011

This is a Web application that is used to import data from a remotely hosted list of missing persons, and populate an instance of Google People Finder with the information. Users are presented with a simple form to paste in the address of remotely hosted data, a confirmation screen shows the imported data and checks for duplicate entries before it is uploaded to the People Finder instance.

We currently support PFIF 1.3 XML, as well as JSON or CSV with PFIF field names.
